ForeSights is enterprise extensible ecommerce solution that utilizes the power of 
math to determine the Safety Score of given business.

## Key Features and Technologies  

### Cognitive Azure Services
Cognitive Services bring AI within reach of every developer—without
requiring machine-learning expertise. 
We mostly use Text Analytics Services to acquired insights 
on unstructured text using natural language processing.
All it takes is an API call to embed the ability 
to understand the context and decide if opinion is negative or positive. 
We also fetch from opinion keywords and later utilize them in our own algorithm.

### SQLite
SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small,
fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

### Statistical Analysis 
We collect, organize, analyze and interpret the data, so our algorithm is as much accurate as possible.
